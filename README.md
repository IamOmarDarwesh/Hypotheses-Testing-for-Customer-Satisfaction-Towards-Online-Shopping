# Hypotheses-Testing-for-Customer-Satisfaction-Towards-Online-Shopping by IBM SPSS Statistics
Conducted a survey to figure out factors that may correlate with and may affect the  customer satisfaction for online shopping experience.



- **Ten factors/variables are collected by ten questions through an online survey** namely Age, 
Product Name, Platform Name, Overall Satisfaction Rate, Delivery Time Rate, Platform Design 
Rate, Packaging Quality Rate, Discount Percent, Waiting Days Rate and Price.



- **Dropped three factors** namely Age, Product Name and Platform Name since they will not help 
figuring out effect as the number of observations is very small.






- **Therefore, all factors used in the statistical tests of the project are:**



      The phenomena/dependent variable is Overall Satisfaction Rate.




      The six independent variables that may correlate with the phenomena are Delivery Time Rate, 
      Platform Design Rate, Packaging Quality Rate, Discount Percent, Waiting Days Rate and Price.
